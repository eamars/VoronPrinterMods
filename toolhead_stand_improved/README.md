Hartk's Toolhead Stand Improved
===
I really like the [Hartk's toolhead](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Non%20Printer%20Voron%20Stuff/Voron_ToolheadStand) stand but also found some issues I'd like to address. 

Here is the list of changes

 - Replace the M3 hole that the toolhead suppose to thread-in directly with the heatset insert (the standard Voron spec). 
 - Extended all existing heatset insert holes to 10mm depth allowing longer screws to be used. This fix the problem where you can't find the screw that has exactly the length you're looking for. 

Sorry no CAD. I fogot to save it ;(
